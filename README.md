### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

Darko Cejkov (DARK-o chey-kov): I am a developer with many interests, but am currently based in Web Design + Development. 

Currently, I'm working with Van Valkenburg Communications (VVC), a multi-media A/V production company, to create a fresh, responsive, and accessible way to attend live meetings and events.

I've previously interned at Traction on Demand under the Marketing Automation discipline, learning how to build emails that are personalized and follow marketing journeys that tailor to customers.

This repository serves as an introduction, and a portfolio into my foray in web design and development. Currently in its early stages, the portfolio is meant to be a mix of different visual methods of web design, including different generative art.

The main framework is React.
