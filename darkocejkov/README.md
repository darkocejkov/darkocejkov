# A bit about this personal project.
This project is meant as a take-away project from the real-world application of React that I've been working so hard at perfecting.\
There are plenty of things that I still need to work and improve upon, but the point is to have fun and explore the more visual sides to web design and development.

## The Challenge
Understandly, designing and curating is all about the editing process. Culling down ideas that don't fit together, or won't be well implemented.\
I'm throwing that out, in order to challenge myself with creating a very elastic and dynamic web interface.
Ultimately, it reflects my personality and my skillset as a developer, and the many different designs that I love to take part in.
